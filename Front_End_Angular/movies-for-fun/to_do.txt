Filter/Sorting/Query Done.
  filter get requests by querying the database for genres
  same but with alphabetical
    Ex. query/find all movies whose title start with "T"

When user hits a letter (T), it will run query with initial data. (t, 0).
The Letter button will then be disabled or not work for that specific letter somewhow.
  Could try: if (!currentLetter === previousLetter) { store currentValue as previous letter; run function; } // so if the user clicks the same letter nothing happens
only until another Letter or filter option is pressed will the previous LetterButton be enabled.
  Pressing another filter option (ex. Genre) will reset the stored previousLetter variable value.
  As stated above, make sure to store the current Letter as the new previousLetter. (Ex. let previousLetter = currentLetter)

Any time the query is called again (Ex. from Load button/scrolling), it uses the saved Char and proper skipNumber(array.length)

        foreach movie in movies[]
          if movie.genre !== genreArg || movie.title[0] !== letterArg
            slice at that index or remove from array
            then readfromarrray();

moviedetail and movieedit
  get movie/data after refresh Done.

make end of db and loadingSpinner show/work better. more fluid.
Not gonna make it show "EndOFDB" if user finds by genre and letter.
not gonna mamke it show for every letter either.
Probably best to leave it at spinner only.
user should know if spinner isnt there and can't scroll more then theyve reached end of page and should refresh or whatever.

had to put a timer delay to test it
it works on pagemovies
gotta try it on switching filter and sort
  then paging forward and back
  even refresh althought i think thats redundant
if its all good rename every "endofdb" to showSpinner or spinnersubject Done.
