Filter/Sorting/Query Done.
  filter get requests by querying the database for genres
  same but with alphabetical
    Ex. query/find all movies whose title start with "T"

When user hits a letter (T), it will run query with initial data. (t, 0).
The Letter button will then be disabled or not work for that specific letter somewhow.
  Could try: if (!currentLetter === previousLetter) { store currentValue as previous letter; run function; } // so if the user clicks the same letter nothing happens
only until another Letter or filter option is pressed will the previous LetterButton be enabled.
  Pressing another filter option (ex. Genre) will reset the stored previousLetter variable value.
  As stated above, make sure to store the current Letter as the new previousLetter. (Ex. let previousLetter = currentLetter)

Any time the query is called again (Ex. from Load button/scrolling), it uses the saved Char and proper skipNumber(array.length)

authenticity or Dealing with duplicates
everytime user treturns to home page, the filter and sort values return to default.
Add modal before navigating back to /movies page after addMovie. (To give time for database to refresh.)

front page
Add alphabetical current letter like genre has.
clean up design, delete extra p tags. turn the bottom ones into white, bigger, with black background. (Maybe add functionality to them)

make title in movieDetail page css: capitalCase.

find/use/implement api for foul language detection.

switching alphabetical to G then back to A delets from memory. Most likely skippping since its too low array of data/collections
